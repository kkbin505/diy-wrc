Use 2 wires to control a L9110 H bridge chip, make a very simple brushed bidirection esc for rc car (500mA only)


DIY Wireless Remote Control

The aim of the project is to build Transmitter and Receiver by using a cheap
and easy to use component such as  Arduino  and nRF24L01 Transceiver. 
It is  still the beginning and the project need more improvement
and additions to be something new and completely different, 
but till  now it is a simple and make-for-fun project for beginners.

I used the  library from https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24
